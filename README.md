## Whats Needed
- GObjects
- GWorld
- Process Event
- Post Render

You'll need IDA to find Process Event , Draw Indexed & Post Render Functions.  
Look at the UnrealEngine Source for your games version and find strings to search for.  
Use the [GuidedHacking Unreal Engine Plugin](https://guidedhacking.com/resources/gh-unreal-engine-dumper-ue4-cheat-engine-plugin.763/) to get the other required classes.
